# 🛡️ FraudShield AI — Digital Public Safety Intelligence Platform

> Built for **ET AI Hackathon 2.0 (2026)** — Problem Statement #6: *AI for Digital Public Safety: Defeating Counterfeiting, Fraud & Digital Arrest Scams*

FraudShield AI is an integrated intelligence platform that helps citizens and law enforcement detect, understand, and respond to India's fastest-growing digital threats — counterfeit currency, digital arrest scams, KYC fraud, and organised fraud networks — by fusing computer vision, conversational AI, and geospatial intelligence into a single unified dashboard.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

- **₹1,776+ crore** lost to "digital arrest" scams in just the first 9 months of 2024 (Ministry of Home Affairs)
- **1.14 million** cybercrime complaints registered in India in 2023 alone — up 60% year-on-year
- Record seizures of high-quality counterfeit ₹500 notes capable of defeating manual bank-teller checks
- Law enforcement has evidence *after* the crime — not intelligence *before* mass victimisation

FraudShield AI shifts the response from **reactive investigation** to **proactive detection and prevention**.

## ✨ Features

### 💵 Counterfeit Currency Detector
A computer-vision model that classifies uploaded currency note images as **REAL** or **FAKE** with a confidence score.
- Built on a CNN (transfer learning) trained on the *Indian Currency Real vs Fake Notes Dataset*
- Covers ₹10 to ₹2000 denominations
- Returns an instant verdict + confidence percentage — usable by bank tellers, retailers, or citizens via a simple photo upload

### 🛡️ Fraud Shield Chat
A conversational AI assistant that helps citizens assess whether a call, message, or situation is a scam in real time.
- Powered by an LLM (Llama 3.3 70B via Groq) with a system prompt specialised in Indian scam patterns
- Pre-screens messages against a curated list of known digital-arrest / KYC-fraud / lottery-scam keywords before escalating to the LLM for deeper analysis
- Returns risk level (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW), scam type, red flags, and immediate action steps in plain language

### 🕸️ Fraud Network Graph
An interactive graph visualisation showing how scammers, money mule accounts, victims, and fraud infrastructure (spoofed numbers, phishing portals, VoIP relays) connect to one another.
- Built with `react-force-graph-2d`
- Click any node to inspect details (amounts, locations, scam type)
- Demonstrates how isolated complaints can be linked into actionable, court-admissible intelligence packages

### 🗺️ Crime Heatmap
A geospatial dashboard plotting fraud complaint density, dominant scam type, and financial impact across major Indian cities.
- Built with `react-leaflet`
- Helps visualise where enforcement and awareness resources would have the highest impact

> **Note:** The Network Graph and Crime Heatmap currently run on representative sample data to demonstrate the intelligence layer's capability. In a production deployment, these would be fed by live NCRB/cybercrime portal complaint data and bank/transaction reporting APIs.
